Contact Microsoft Support for guidance.Escrows - Provisioning failures are marked as escrows and retried. Clearing escrows will stop the service from retrying failures.Watermark - Removing the watermark causes the service to reevaluate all the users again, rather than just processing changes.QuarantineState - Temporarily lifts the quarantine.Use Full if you want all of the options.ForceDeletes - Forces the system to delete the pending deleted users when using the accidental deletions prevention feature and the deletion threshold is exceeded. Leaving this property empty emulates the Restart provisioning option in the Microsoft Entra admin center. It is similar to setting the resetScope to include QuarantineState, Watermark, and Escrows. This option meets most customer needs.
