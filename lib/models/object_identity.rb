The validations performed on the userPrincipalName property on the user object, for example, verified domains and acceptable characters, are performed when setting or updating a userPrincipalName identity. Extra validation is enforced on issuerAssignedId when the sign-in type is set to emailAddress or userName. This property can also be set to any custom string.
