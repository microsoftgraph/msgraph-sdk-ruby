The owner of the schema definition must be explicitly specified during the Create and Update operations, or it will be implied and auto-assigned by Azure AD as follows: In delegated access: The signed-in user must be the owner of the app that calls Microsoft Graph to create the schema extension definition.  If the signed-in user isn't the owner of the calling app, they must explicitly specify the owner property, and assign it the appId of an app that they own. In app-only access:  The owner property isn't required in the request body. Instead, the calling app is assigned ownership of the schema extension. So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you must supply the owner property. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
