                    ## Log video teleconferencing device quality data. The Cloud Video Interop (CVI) bot represents video teleconferencing (VTC) devices and acts as a back-to-back agent for a VTC device in a conference call. Because a CVI bot is in the middle of the VTC and Microsoft Teams infrastructure as a VTC proxy, it has two media legs. One media leg is between the CVI bot and Teams infrastructure, such as Teams conference server or a Teams client. The other media leg is between the CVI bot and the VTC device.  The third-party partners own the VTC media leg and the Teams infrastructure cannot access the quality data of the third-party call leg.  This method is only for the CVI partners to provide their media quality data.
